# Call-Subscription
The purpose of this code is to get every call event from the Netsapiens phone system and pull out every time a call goes to voicemail or someone is called back.  From there it will add that to a MySQL database.  Another script watches the MySQL database and displays the info to the user so they can see every time they miss a call and if someone calls them back.
